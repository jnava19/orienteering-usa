This early stage module for D6. It let you add icons to OpenLayers maps in 2 clicks.

To get it working:

1) Create a directory 'library' in the module directory
2) Drop in some directories containing icons:
    Example:
      - http://code.google.com/p/google-maps-icons/
3) Your tree should look like:
    /googlemapsicons
      |
      |-library
          |
          |-map-icons-collection-2.0
              |
              |-icons
              |-numeric

4) Enable the module
5) go at url admin/build/openlayers/styles of your drupal sites and you should see all the icons like that: http://img713.imageshack.us/i/screenshot20110417at110.png/

Notice: the styles page might be slow to load due to the huge amount of icons available in some sets.
