MoneyScripts Membership Suite 6 for Drupal
By: Leighton Whiting

I have been working with drupal for a long time to build my sites, because it is so easy to use and set-up, and there are so many pre-made themes and modules available for it. One of the things that I have found is very lacking in drupal is a good way for you to configure paid subscriptions to your site. I once set up a site for a client which used Amember to handle Member Subscriptions and then integrated it with the drupal database. This was a very messy solution but it worked at least. I have searched and searched in vain trying to find a simple 'Plug and Play' module that would allow such a thing. I tried the e-Commerce module and also the Ubercart module. Both are fine modules but are very complicated and still in development phases. I tried using both of these to handle Paid Memberships, but found that neither of them worked for me. In the end, I decided to custom make a module to handle Paid Memberships and Subscriptions, and this is what I have come up with.
Membership Suite is built on the most comprehensive subscription software on the market and it is designed to seamlessly integrate your site with all of the features of a professional Paid Membership Subscription site. There is no other software available for Drupal that can provide the stability, ease of use, and features that Membership Suite offers.

Membership Suite is designed to let you sell Memberships, which control the granting and expiry of roles to your users, which in turn will allow you to restrict access to certain areas of your sites, or give certain paying members more access or permissions to do things such as upload files, leave comments, create content, etc. The possibilities are limitless due to the extendable nature and 1000s of contributed modules of Drupal.
